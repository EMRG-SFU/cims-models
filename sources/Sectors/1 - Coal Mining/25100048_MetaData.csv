2,"Subbituminous: A black coal used primarily for thermal generation with a moisture content between 15% and 30%."
3,"Lignite: A brownish-black coal of low rank containing 30% to 40% moisture and volatile matter. Used almost exclusively for electric power generation."
4,"Now available on a quarterly basis; see CANSIM table 303-0017, Coal statistics, quarterly."

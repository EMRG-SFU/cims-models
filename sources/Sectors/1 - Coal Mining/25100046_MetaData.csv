1,"For monthly data prior to January 2008, please see archived table 25-10-0048. For current monthly data on coal coke plant statistics, see also table 25-10-0045."
2,"Bituminous: a dense, black coal, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material with a moisture content usually less than 20%. Used primarily for generating electricity, making coke and space heating."
3,"Coal to be used in metallurgical process (ultimate production of steel)."
4,"Coal to be used in combustion process to produce steam (in industrial process or electricity generation)."
5,"Subbituminous: a black coal used primarily for thermal generation with a moisture content between 15% and 30%."
6,"Lignite: a brownish-black coal of low rank containing 30% to 40% moisture and volatile matter. Used almost exclusively for electric power generation."

abstract: >-
  CIMS is an integrated energy-economy model designed to
  provide information to policy makers on the likely
  response of firms and households to policies that
  influence their technology acquisition and use decisions.
  As a technology simulation model, it reflects how people
  actually behave rather than how they ought to behave (as
  in cost minimization modelling). CIMS is able to provide
  policy makers with information on: (1) the ability of
  policies to achieve specific objectives (like greenhouse
  gas emissions reductions), (2) the likely costs of
  achieving these objectives, and (3) the uncertainties
  associated with the modelâ€™s simulations. 

  CIMS is maintained and operated by the Energy and
  Materials Research Group at the School of Resource and
  Environmental Management at Simon Fraser University in
  Burnaby, B.C., Canada.

  Funding for the development of the initial version of this
  project was provided by the Pacific Institute for Climate
  Solutions Opportunity Projects Program, Natural Resources
  Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada.
